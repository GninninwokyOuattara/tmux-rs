# tmux-rs

A rust port of [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

## Why?

Why not? This a fun hobby project for me. It's been my gardening for the past year.

## Why not just use [zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

I like tmux. I want tmux, not something else. Also I tried out using it before and the compilation time was 8 minutes on my machine.
That's a bit to long for me.
